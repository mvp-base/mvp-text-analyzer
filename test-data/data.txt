The hygiene package has given rise to debate in several Member States, including Sweden.
In the great majority of cases, however, the problem has not been the legislation in itself but the implementation of the legislation by the national authorities.
The EU is sacrificing public health for the sake of the profits of European monopolies, which are demanding fewer checks and restraints.
A typical example of EU policy is the latest food scandal of sunflower oil mixed with petroleum, with its disastrous effects on health.
Instead of taking measures to step up restraints on the uncontrolled proceedings of multinationals, the EU and the Member States' governments are merely intervening on exports of sunflower oil from Ukraine.
At the same time, the EU Food Safety Directive is allowing oils and other liquid cargoes intended for human consumption to be carried by container ships transporting petroleum oils and other toxic fluids.
On the pretext of reducing administrative costs for small businesses, the Commission proposes to make yet another exception to the Food Safety Directive, which in itself is inadequate.
